    "text": "Installing R and RStudio\nFirst install R and then install RStudio (this second step is highly recommended but not required, if you prefer another IDE and you’re sure you know what you’re doing). Finally, open RStudio and install the tidyverse set of packages by running the command\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nNote: If you use a Mac or Linux-based computer you may want to install these using a package manager instead of downloading them from the websites linked above. Personally, on a Mac computer I use Homebrew (the link has instructions for how to install it) to install R and RStudio."
