title: "Introduction, normative ethics, and causality"

## Introduction

We begin by considering many examples within two broad themes: the replication crisis in science and fairness and inequality in algorithmic or data-driven systems.

##  Installing `R` and `RStudio`

First [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and then install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (this second step is highly recommended but not required, if you prefer another IDE and you're sure you know what you're doing). Finally, open RStudio and install the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) set of packages by running the command

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

**Note**: If you use a Mac or Linux-based computer you may want to install these using a package manager instead of downloading them from the websites linked above. Personally, on a Mac computer I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (the link has instructions for how to install it) to [install R](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/r) and [RStudio](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/rstudio).
